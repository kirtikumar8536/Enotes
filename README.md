## Enotes Management System

### Description:
Enotes Management System is a dynamic notes application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. This application provides user-friendly functionality for adding, updating, and deleting notes.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaServer Pages (JSP)
- Servlets
- Tomcat Server
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- MySQL


### Features:
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for notes.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure an intuitive user experience.
- **Java OOP Concepts**: Utilized Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Robust Database Management**: Utilized Servlets, JSP, and Hibernate for seamless functionality and efficient database management.
- **MVC Architecture**: Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate the presentation layer (JSP), business logic (Servlets), and data access (Hibernate) for better code organization and maintainability.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Apache Tomcat installed.
2. Set up a MySQL database and update the JDBC connection details in the project.
3. Deploy the project on Apache Tomcat.
4. Access the application through the browser.
